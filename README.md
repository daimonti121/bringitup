ðŸ“˜ Loan â€” Multi-Page Website with Full OOP Architecture and YouTube API Integration

ðŸ”§ Task:
Develop a multi-page website with an interactive UI and a fully object-oriented architecture in JavaScript (ES6). Key focus areas: modularity, component reusability, third-party API integration, and UX animations.

ðŸ›  Technologies:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Animate.css, YouTube IFrame API, Fetch API (AJAX), RegExp, async/await.

ðŸ’¡ Implemented:

ðŸ”¹ OOP Architecture:
* The entire functionality is based on ES6 classes and constructor functions.
* Applied key principles: inheritance, encapsulation, this context, and bind() binding.
* Well-structured modules and components allow for easy scalability.

ðŸ”¹ Sliders:
* Main slider with arrow controls and Animate.css animations.
* Clicking the logo returns to the first slide.
* Secondary sliders:
  * Manual switch with active state.
  * Auto-switch every 5 seconds with pause on hover.
  * Video preview with description and interactive playback.

ðŸ”¹ YouTube API Video Integration:
* Videos play in a modal window.
* Auto-stop and reset on modal close.

ðŸ”¹ "Differences" Section (Second Slide):
* Interactive elements with show/hide animations triggered by clicks.
* Final click transforms the block into text content.

ðŸ”¹ Forms & Data Submission:
* AJAX with Fetch API and async/await.
* Email validation allows only Cyrillic (Latin characters blocked).
* Phone input mask: +1 (USA).
* Submit button disabled during sending.
* Animated form hiding/restoring with status messages: loading/success/failure.
* Fields auto-clear after submission.

ðŸ”¹ Video Modules (Modules.html):
* Two video players: the second unlocks only after the first is viewed.
* Slider module navigation: next/prev.

ðŸ”¹ Additional Interactivity:
* Accordion for content.
* Download PDF button â€” triggers file download on click.

âœ… Result:
* A logic-heavy yet intuitive UI.
* Clean, modular, scalable codebase using modern JavaScript principles.
* A strong example of well-structured architecture and implementation from scratch.
